					<h2>The red panda is dwarfed by the black-and-white giant that shares its name.</h2>
				</main>

				<section>

					<h3>Habitat</h3>
					<p>The red panda shares the giant panda's rainy, high-altitude forest habitat, but has a wider range. Red pandas range from northern Myanmar (Burma) to the west Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces of China. They are also found in suitable habitat in Nepal, India and Tibet. These animals spend most of their lives in trees and even sleep aloft.</p>

					<h3>Communication</h3>
					<p>Red pandas are generally quiet, but subtle vocalizations—such as squeals, twitters and huff-quacks—can be heard at close proximity. They may also hiss or grunt, and young cubs use a whistle, or high-pitched bleat, to signal distress.</p>

					<h3>Eating Habits</h3> 
					<p>Bamboo constitutes 85 to 95 percent of the red panda's diet. Unlike giant pandas that feed on nearly every above-ground portion of bamboo (including the culm, or woody stem), red pandas feed selectively on the most nutritious leaf tips and, when available, tender shoots.They may also forage for roots, succulent grasses, fruits, insects and grubs, and are known to occasionally kill and eat birds and small mammals.</p>

					<h3>Sleeping</h3>
					<p>In human care, red pandas can be active at any time of day but most active at dawn and dusk. On average, they spend about 45 percent of the day awake and tend to be more active in cooler weather, especially during the winter mating season. In significantly cold temperatures, red pandas can become dormant, lowering their metabolic rate and raising it every few hours as they wake up to look for food.</p>
