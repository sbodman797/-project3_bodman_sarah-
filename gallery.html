				<h1 id="h1sub">The Cute Red Panda</h1>
				<p> The red panda has long reddish brown fur on its upper parts, blackish fur on its lower parts and a light face with white markings similar to those on a raccoon, and each red panda has individual markings. This reddish coat and the white markings give them great camouflage amongst the red moss and white lichen that covers the tree trunks of the bamboo forest home they live in. They have a roundish head with a black nose, dark eyes and medium sized upright ears. They have a thick bushy tail with six yellowish red rings that is extremely long. The tail can measure in length from about 28 to 49 cms (11 to 19 in) and is used by the red panda to help in balance in the trees, they also use it to cover themselves with in the cold, high altitudes in which they live.. They have short black legs and they have fur on the soles of their feet that stop them slipping on wet branches and also helps to keep them warm. The claws on their feet are semi retractable so that they are not damaged when they are walking on the ground and are kept sharp for climbing the trees. The average body length of the red panda is 51 to 64 cms (20 to 25 in) with the tail length being 28 to 49 cms (11 to 19 in). The average weight of the male red panda is 4.5 to 6.2 kgs (10 to 14 pounds) and the females 3 to 4.5 kgs (6 to 10 pounds). In all, just remember that they are cute.</p>
